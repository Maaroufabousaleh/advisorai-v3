# V3 implementation audit

This audit maps the authoritative architecture and its phase sub-plans to the
current executable base. “Local” means the boundary, contract, or deterministic
fixture exists in this repository. It does not convert an external, timed, or
human gate into a unit-test claim.

## Global invariant checks

- No gateway, agent, Hermes task, browser job, capability, or model adapter has
  an order-submission or risk-limit-relaxation action.
- Risk decisions bind the immutable policy ID plus account and market state
  hashes; ordinary callers reject by default, and target reduction is explicit.
- Orders, fills, account events, reconciliations, capability/model/challenger
  transitions, incidents, and Phase-0 gate records are idempotent and replayable
  from local ledgers.
- PIT snapshots reject future availability/ingestion/event data; quality
  dashboards retain lineage, revision, origin, disagreement, and cutoff state.
- The acceptance runner executes phases in order and stops at the first failed
  phase. It reports only local executable evidence; it never opens a live gate.

## Verification record

The latest local run on 2026-08-08 passed all 496 tests in one process with the
optional Nautilus runtime active, and all eleven isolated phase suites. The exact
phase distribution and static checks are kept in
[`status.md`](status.md). Phase 0’s 24-hour evidence, Phase 7’s 60-day soak, and
Phase 10’s human/live approval remain intentionally pending. Repository-wide Ruff
format checking passes with all 232 Python files formatted. The Phase-1 local
rollback/Bronze rebuild report is immutable evidence with SHA-256
`6e8cd86017dacea7b4a0fff8e9ea41901ec4bb7ee02961f5811dcbb7266342b2` and does
not open any external or human gate. The Phase-0 component evidence report is
immutable evidence with SHA-256
`2a5c9d07be845b7222a065edc4d20a4a8d272bf7780918d3f27ad42abbb0523c`; it also
does not open any external or human gate. The Phase-8 capability report is
immutable evidence with SHA-256
`d6e44c90574c5209bd658319637605a00269fe49fe9cad7120766ecdc2cd79e5`; it also
records enforced child socket/DNS, read-only filesystem, conventional
sensitive-path and process-environment metadata policies, common process-spawn
denial, and does not create a formal gate record or global capability admission.
Direct native syscalls/C-extension escapes are outside this in-process evidence
and require separate OS-level sandbox attestation.

The current requirement-to-evidence matrix is
[`gate-matrix.md`](gate-matrix.md). It records the fresh detached Phase-0
stability run, the DuckLake challenger rejection, the pinned upstream Hermes
review, and the remaining operator/time-dependent gates without promoting any
of them to formal admission.
