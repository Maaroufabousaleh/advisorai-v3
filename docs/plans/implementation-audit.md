# V3 implementation audit

This audit maps the authoritative architecture and its phase sub-plans to the
current executable base. “Local” means the boundary, contract, or deterministic
fixture exists in this repository. It does not convert an external, timed, or
human gate into a unit-test claim.

| 4 | Mandatory naive/drift/seasonal/linear/LightGBM boundaries; real isolated ModernFinBERT/MiniLM/DeBERTa, TTM-R2/R3, TSPulse, Chronos and Kronos workers; frozen public walk-forward and sentiment evaluation; one-family GPU lease; evidence-bound role roster | [`tests/models`](../../tests/models), [`tests/phase0`](../../tests/phase0) | Selected-role 24-hour stability and later paper net-utility evidence; TabPFN-TS waits on gated terms |
| 5 | Policy Mission Router; bounded adaptive council waves; typed role results; snapshot/mission-bound runs; ancestry-aware evidence graph; dissent/expiry/cutoff handling; target-only DecisionBundle and RiskKernel hand-off | [`tests/agents`](../../tests/agents), [`tests/api`](../../tests/api) | Real provider route selection and scored multi-factor evidence from live V3-Core data |
| 6 | Benchmark portfolio comparisons; robust covariance/factors/capacity/margin/stress; purged walk-forward, multiple-testing, sensitivity/regime checks; TCA/P&L attribution; incident/postmortem reconciliation; model challenge evidence | [`tests/institutional`](../../tests/institutional), [`tests/data/test_observability.py`](../../tests/data/test_observability.py) | Production paper-order sample proving exact attribution and unresolved-incident handling |
| 7 | Durable soak samples/gate; data/model/agent/risk/execution scorecard fields; measured headroom and no-trade/benchmark net-utility checks; all required adverse scenarios; ledger-backed sample rebuild; recovery report and archive-restore boundary | [`tests/recovery/test_soak.py`](../../tests/recovery/test_soak.py) | At least 60 calendar days, meaningful adverse sample, stable resources, clean reconciliation, and positive net utility |

| 9 | Vintaged SEC/ALFRED boundary; equity corporate-action/daily-council boundary; compliant browser ladder; one-at-a-time challenger registry; duplicate-provider rejection, safe archive keys, and two-provider archive verification/rclone boundary | [`tests/expansion`](../../tests/expansion), [`tests/data/test_official.py`](../../tests/data/test_official.py) | Marginal-value and headroom evidence for each real source/model/framework addition |
| 10 | Explicit human authorization artifact; fixed loss/notional budget; policy/state-hash-bound final order guard; AI-offline safety check; automatic paper-rollback readiness | [`tests/live`](../../tests/live) | Phase 7 completion, explicit human approval, and supervised bounded live validation |
| Alpha Team extension | Integrated plan and conformance boundary only; no Research Brain, DSL, candidate, experiment, validation, or promotion implementation is claimed by this row | None; future evidence must be tied to the E0-E7 gate in [`alpha-team-extension.md`](alpha-team-extension.md) | E0 is not yet satisfied; no Alpha Team runtime, paper candidate, or admission evidence is claimed |

## Global invariant checks

- No gateway, agent, Hermes task, browser job, capability, or model adapter has
  an order-submission or risk-limit-relaxation action.
- Risk decisions bind the immutable policy ID plus account and market state
  hashes; ordinary callers reject by default, and target reduction is explicit.
- Orders, fills, account events, reconciliations, capability/model/challenger
  transitions, incidents, and Phase-0 gate records are idempotent and replayable
  from local ledgers.
- PIT snapshots reject future availability/ingestion/event data; quality
  dashboards retain lineage, revision, origin, disagreement, and cutoff state.
- The acceptance runner executes phases in order and stops at the first failed
  phase. It reports only local executable evidence; it never opens a live gate.

## Verification record

The latest local run on 2026-08-07 passed all 476 tests in one process with the
optional Nautilus runtime active, and all eleven isolated phase suites. The exact
phase distribution and static checks are kept in
[`status.md`](status.md). Phase 0’s 24-hour evidence, Phase 7’s 60-day soak, and
Phase 10’s human/live approval remain intentionally pending. Repository-wide Ruff
format checking passes with all 223 Python files formatted.
