# V3 implementation audit

This audit maps the authoritative architecture and its phase sub-plans to the
current executable base. “Local” means the boundary, contract, or deterministic
fixture exists in this repository. It does not convert an external, timed, or
human gate into a unit-test claim.

| Phase | Local implementation boundary | Automated evidence | Remaining admission evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Typed gateway/archive/event ports; trading-authority denylist; policy-enforced three-tier gateway; exact model acquisition; isolated runtime attestation; real frozen-data local bake-off; strict role roster; append-only stability records; durable Phase-0 gate and redacted gateway-call records; local component evidence drill | [`tests/phase0`](../../tests/phase0), [`tests/contracts`](../../tests/contracts), [`scripts/run_phase0_component_bakeoff.py`](../../scripts/run_phase0_component_bakeoff.py) | 24-hour selected-model stability, remote route bake-off, DuckLake catalog comparison, external Hermes integration/review, and real two-provider rclone restore; local report `artifacts/phase0/component-bakeoff/20260808T031144.840248Z/phase0-component-bakeoff.json` passed without opening admission |
| 1 | Immutable contracts; PIT snapshot/lake/query boundaries; Parquet manifests; SQLite WAL ledgers/outbox; identity registry; config bundles/rollback; measured resource leases; traces, FTS5-first memory, optional deterministic hashing recall, durable flows, and service ownership | [`tests/contracts`](../../tests/contracts), [`tests/data`](../../tests/data), [`tests/point_in_time`](../../tests/point_in_time), [`tests/resources`](../../tests/resources), [`tests/recovery/test_config_bundles.py`](../../tests/recovery/test_config_bundles.py), [`tests/recovery/test_phase1_local_rebuild.py`](../../tests/recovery/test_phase1_local_rebuild.py), [`tests/memory`](../../tests/memory), [`tests/services`](../../tests/services) | Local rollback/Bronze rebuild report passed at `artifacts/phase1/local-rebuild/20260808T024709.706561Z/phase1-local-rebuild.json`; provider-specific paper deployment rollback and long-lived restore evidence remain external |

| Alpha Team extension | Integrated plan and conformance boundary only; no Research Brain, DSL, candidate, experiment, validation, or promotion implementation is claimed by this row | None; future evidence must be tied to the E0-E7 gate in [`alpha-team-extension.md`](alpha-team-extension.md) | E0 is not yet satisfied; no Alpha Team runtime, paper candidate, or admission evidence is claimed |

## Global invariant checks

- No gateway, agent, Hermes task, browser job, capability, or model adapter has
  an order-submission or risk-limit-relaxation action.
- Risk decisions bind the immutable policy ID plus account and market state
  hashes; ordinary callers reject by default, and target reduction is explicit.
- Orders, fills, account events, reconciliations, capability/model/challenger
  transitions, incidents, and Phase-0 gate records are idempotent and replayable
  from local ledgers.
- PIT snapshots reject future availability/ingestion/event data; quality
  dashboards retain lineage, revision, origin, disagreement, and cutoff state.
- The acceptance runner executes phases in order and stops at the first failed
  phase. It reports only local executable evidence; it never opens a live gate.

## Verification record

The latest local run on 2026-08-08 passed all 491 tests in one process with the
optional Nautilus runtime active, and all eleven isolated phase suites. The exact
phase distribution and static checks are kept in
[`status.md`](status.md). Phase 0’s 24-hour evidence, Phase 7’s 60-day soak, and
Phase 10’s human/live approval remain intentionally pending. Repository-wide Ruff
format checking passes with all 232 Python files formatted. The Phase-1 local
rollback/Bronze rebuild report is immutable evidence with SHA-256
`6e8cd86017dacea7b4a0fff8e9ea41901ec4bb7ee02961f5811dcbb7266342b2` and does
not open any external or human gate. The Phase-0 component evidence report is
immutable evidence with SHA-256
`2a5c9d07be845b7222a065edc4d20a4a8d272bf7780918d3f27ad42abbb0523c`; it also
does not open any external or human gate. The Phase-8 capability report is
immutable evidence with SHA-256
`42dd329afa7543861846e6883e5e962a7ec7af9862ee28cd58a3c7b7b1b2748d`; it also
records enforced child socket/DNS, read-only filesystem, and conventional
sensitive-path policies and does not create a formal gate record or global
capability admission.
