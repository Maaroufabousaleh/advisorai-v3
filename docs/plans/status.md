# Implementation status and gate evidence

This record distinguishes implementation coverage from an architecture gate that
requires external, time-based evidence. A green unit test does not claim a 24-hour
or 60-day operational gate.

| Phase | Implementation | Automated evidence | Gate status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Harness, ports, policy-enforced model gateway, exact model acquisition, isolated/attested local runtimes, real public-data local bake-off, role roster, append-only stability runner, and durable Phase-0 gate records | `tests/phase0`, gateway/port tests, immutable local bake-off report | Local candidates measured; selected TTM-R2/DeBERTa/MiniLM roles pending 24-hour stability and remaining non-model component gates |
| 1 | Contracts, PIT lake, DuckDB/Polars query, ledgers, typed V3-Core YAML admission, config rollback, resources, traces, FTS5-first memory with optional deterministic hashing recall, durable flows/incidents, and explicit service ownership/mode boundaries | contracts/data/config/recovery/resource/orchestration/memory/service tests | Local gate fixtures pass; operational config rollback evidence remains required |
| 2 | Paper event spool/replay, typed native market events, account and margin/borrow/FX/corporate-action accounting, durable-first account/OMS retries, signed target constraints, combined-state-hash RiskKernel/OMS binding, paper/native testnet boundary with read-only account projection, venue-projection reconciliation, TCA, cadence-gated runtime admission | `tests/execution`, `tests/integrations`, `tests/runtime` | Paper failure fixtures pass; Nautilus remains Phase 0 governed despite being installed and locally tested |
| 3 | Native/Deribit/RSS/GDELT/official-vintage parsers, raw-first REST/WSS replay, typed trade/book/bar/funding/open-interest normalization, origin/revision/availability, quality monitor | `tests/data` | Parser/lineage fixtures pass; source availability dashboards need live soak |
| 4 | Naive/statistical/LightGBM boundary, isolated ModernFinBERT/MiniLM/DeBERTa and TTM-R2/R3/TSPulse/Chronos/Kronos runtimes, calibration, GPU lease, public walk-forward/finance-sentiment measurements, and evidence-bound roster | `tests/models`, `tests/phase0`, measured local roster | Role winners are pending stability; point-in-time paper utility remains a later admission gate |
| 5 | Router, typed roles, bounded adaptive waves, evidence graph, independence gates, DecisionBundle and expiry/cutoff binding | `tests/agents`, `tests/api` | Correlated-evidence and target-only boundaries pass |
| 6 | Portfolio comparisons, risk analytics/stress, validation, attribution incidents | `tests/institutional` | Deterministic controls pass |
| 7 | Soak records/gate, incident-ledger rebuild, and immutable recovery rebuild | `tests/recovery/test_soak.py` | Requires actual 60-day paper operation and restore drills |
| 8 | Hermes policy, bounded isolation runner, sensitive-environment scrubbing, artifact/capability lifecycle and broker | `tests/capabilities` | Sandbox integration and review evidence still required |
| 9 | Vintaged official releases, equity corporate-action/daily-council boundary, challenger registry, browser ladder, archive verification | `tests/expansion` | Requires one-at-a-time live data/challenger evidence |
| 10 | Human approval, bounded live readiness, AI-offline invariant, order guard | `tests/live` | Must remain closed until Phase 7 and explicit human approval pass |
| 0–7 bridge | Typed secret loader/redaction, reviewed connector cards, HTTPS/WSS transport guards, direct typed LLM adapter, durable gateway-call records, paper/testnet HMAC venue transport with signed open-order reconciliation and read-only account/fill/position/balance projection, raw-first native market normalization/replay, cadence-gated closed-cutoff `PaperRuntime` with durable kill-switch/dashboard control hydration and terminal per-order risk rejection, durable resource measurements/leases, refreshing/deduplicated ledger-backed dashboard/config projection, incident/replay/post-horizon scorecards | `tests/config/test_secrets.py`, `tests/integrations`, `tests/runtime`, `tests/learning`, `tests/resources`, `tests/data/test_market_events.py`, `tests/api/test_dashboard.py` | Local contracts pass; provider-specific endpoint smoke, continuous operation, Phase 0 stability, Phase 7 soak, and human decisions remain external |
| Alpha Team extension | Plan-only integration for optional E0-E7 research work | None | E0 and all later gates remain closed; no Alpha Team implementation or admission evidence is claimed |

The current repository therefore has broad executable coverage, but does not claim
Phase 0, Phase 7, or Phase 10 gates without the external evidence explicitly named
above.

Latest local verification (2026-08-07):
`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 ./.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_acceptance.py`
passed all eleven phase suites, with suite results of
Phase 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 = 116/151/96/22/19/34/10/7/9/11/5. Suite totals
overlap a few shared contract tests. A single-process
`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 ./.venv/bin/pytest -q` passes all 476 collected
tests with the optional Nautilus runtime active. The acceptance runner stops at the
first failed phase, so later suites are never counted as evidence after an
earlier gate failure. The Phase 0 inventory was regenerated at
`artifacts/phase0/availability.json` (ignored runtime output), and remains an
availability record rather than an admission decision. The local static and
reproducibility checks pass for Ruff lint, dependency locking, bytecode compilation,
diff hygiene, and the dashboard TypeScript/Vite build. The recent scoped code
changes are formatted. A repository-wide
`./.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` still reports 31 pre-existing files that would
be reformatted, so that separate hygiene item remains open. The test collection
check reports 476 collected tests. The dashboard build passes with `npm run build`
from `dashboard/`.
